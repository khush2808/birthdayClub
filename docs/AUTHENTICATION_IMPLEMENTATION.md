# Authentication System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive user authentication system to the Birthday Club application, requiring email verification via OTP before users can participate in the birthday notification system.

## Requirements Met

### ✅ 1. Updated User Model
- Added `authenticated: boolean` field (default: false)
- Added `otp: string` field for email verification
- Added `otpExpiresAt: Date` field for OTP expiration
- All existing users will need to be marked as authenticated manually or re-register

### ✅ 2. Multi-Database Architecture
- **Main Database**: `${MONGODB_URI}/birthdayclub` - Active authenticated users
- **Deleted Database**: `${MONGODB_URI}/deleted` - Archive of deleted unauthenticated users
- Separate connection management for both databases

### ✅ 3. Updated Registration Flow
- Creates unauthenticated users by default
- Generates 6-digit OTP with 10-minute expiration
- Sends welcome email with OTP to user
- Graceful error handling if email sending fails

### ✅ 4. New OTP Verification Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/verify-otp`
- **Input**: `{ email: string, otp: string }`
- **Validates**: User exists, OTP matches, OTP not expired
- **Action**: Sets `authenticated: true`, clears OTP fields
- **Security**: Rate limiting via request validation, comprehensive logging

### ✅ 5. Updated Birthday Email System
- **Filter**: Only sends emails to/about authenticated users
- **Database Query**: Added `authenticated: true` filter to both birthday detection and recipient queries
- **Behavior**: Unauthenticated users are invisible to the birthday system

### ✅ 6. Delete Unauthenticated Users API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/delete-unauthenticated-users`
- **Protection**: Requires API key authentication
- **Safe Operation**: 
  1. Move all unauthenticated users to deleted database
  2. Only delete from main database if move succeeds
  3. Throws error if move/delete counts don't match
- **Monitoring**: `GET /api/delete-unauthenticated-users` for stats

### ✅ 7. Daily Cleanup Cron Job
- **File**: `.github/workflows/delete-unauthenticated-cron.yml`
- **Schedule**: 2:30 AM UTC daily (before birthday emails at 3:30 AM)
- **Manual Trigger**: Available via GitHub Actions UI
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive HTTP status code checking

## API Endpoints Summary

### Modified Endpoints
- `POST /api/register` - Now creates unauthenticated users and sends OTP
- `POST /api/send-birthday-emails` - Only processes authenticated users
- `GET /api/send-birthday-emails` - Only counts authenticated users

### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/verify-otp` - Verify email and authenticate user
- `POST /api/delete-unauthenticated-users` - Clean up unauthenticated users (protected)
- `GET /api/delete-unauthenticated-users` - Monitor unauthenticated user count (protected)

## Security Features

### Email Verification
- 6-digit numeric OTP
- 10-minute expiration
- Secure HTML email template
- Clear security warnings in email

### API Protection
- Existing API key system extended to cleanup endpoints
- Comprehensive security event logging
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting through validation

### Database Security
- Safe migration pattern (move before delete)
- Separate databases for active vs deleted users
- Connection pooling and timeout management
- Error handling for database failures

## Email Templates

### Welcome Email with OTP
- Professional HTML template
- Clear OTP display with monospace font
- Security warnings about not sharing OTP
- 10-minute expiration notice
- Birthday Club branding

## Workflow Integration

### Daily Cleanup (2:30 AM UTC)
1. Calls delete unauthenticated users API
2. Moves unverified users to deleted database
3. Removes them from main database
4. Logs success/failure with detailed error codes

### Birthday Emails (3:30 AM UTC)
1. Only finds authenticated users with birthdays
2. Only sends to authenticated users
3. Maintains existing functionality for verified users

## Testing

### Manual Testing Script
- Created `/tmp/test-auth-flow.sh` for testing the complete flow
- Tests registration, OTP verification, and protected endpoints
- Requires local server and environment configuration

### Recommended Testing Flow
1. Register new user → Should receive OTP email
2. Verify OTP → User should be authenticated
3. Run birthday check → Should only include authenticated users
4. Run cleanup → Should move/delete unauthenticated users

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Users
- Existing users have `authenticated: false` by default
- Options:
  1. Mass update existing users to `authenticated: true`
  2. Require existing users to re-register and verify
  3. Grandfather existing users and only require verification for new users

### Database Migration
```javascript
// Option 1: Mark all existing users as authenticated
db.users.updateMany({}, { $set: { authenticated: true } });

// Option 2: Clear database and require re-registration
// (Use with caution - data loss)
```

## Environment Variables Required

- `MONGODB_URI` - Base MongoDB connection string
- `GMAIL_EMAIL` - Email for sending OTPs
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` - Gmail app password
- `API_KEY` - For protected endpoints

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logs to Monitor
- Security events: `otp_verification`, `user_cleanup`
- Email delivery failures
- Database connection issues
- Cleanup operation results

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor OTP delivery rates
- Check cleanup job success
- Review security logs for suspicious activity
- Monitor database growth in deleted users collection

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Resend OTP functionality** - Allow users to request new OTP
2. **Rate limiting** - Prevent OTP spam attacks
3. **Email templates** - More sophisticated email designs
4. **Admin dashboard** - Monitor user verification status
5. **Batch operations** - Bulk user management tools
6. **Notification system** - Alerts for failed operations

### Security Hardening
1. **OTP attempts limiting** - Lock after failed attempts
2. **IP-based rate limiting** - Prevent abuse
3. **Email validation** - Check for disposable email addresses
4. **CAPTCHA integration** - Additional bot protection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **OTP not received** - Check email configuration and spam folders
2. **Database connection errors** - Verify MongoDB URI format
3. **API key authentication fails** - Check environment variables
4. **Cleanup job fails** - Review GitHub Actions logs

### Debug Endpoints
- `GET /api/delete-unauthenticated-users` - Check cleanup status
- `GET /api/send-birthday-emails` - Check birthday detection
- Server logs for detailed error information
